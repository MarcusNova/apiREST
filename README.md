# API rest
Hi my name is Jhonatan, in this project I made an API rest using Node, the framework Express and MongoDB.

This api rest was build with babel to use modern javascript with node and express with the module mongoose to
use the NoSQL mongoDB. Also I used some libraries from babel and node to improve my development time.
